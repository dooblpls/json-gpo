# ADMX Web Viewer üöÄ

**The ultimate modern replacement for legacy Group Policy search tools. Find, explore, and understand ADMX-backed Group Policies with unparalleled ease and speed.**

Tired of clunky interfaces and outdated databases from sites like `admx help`, `gpsearch`, or being redirected to malicious websites (shout-out to `getadmx`)? ADMX Web Viewer is your new go-to solution for navigating the complex world of Administrative Templates (ADMX).

Built with modern web technologies, this tool provides a fast, intuitive, and searchable interface to explore Group Policy settings from various ADMX sources, including Windows versions (like Windows 11 24H2, Windows 10) and applications like Microsoft Edge.

## üéØ Why ADMX Web Viewer?

This project aims to be the definitive, open-source, and community-driven successor to tools like:

*   `admx help`
*   `gpsearch` (Group Policy Search)
*   `getadmx` (for easily browsing ADMX file contents)
*   The need for a modern `Group Policy Central Store` browser.

It addresses the common pain points of system administrators, IT professionals, security consultants, and anyone working with Windows Group Policies:

*   Finding specific policies quickly.
*   Understanding the underlying registry settings.
*   Comparing policies across different Windows versions or applications.
*   Accessing up-to-date policy information.
*   No more issues with dead websites

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works & Technology Stack

ADMX Web Viewer is a client-side single-page application (SPA).

*   **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript (ES6+), Tailwind CSS
*   **Data:** JSON files (parsed from ADMX/ADML files using Generate-AdmxJson.ps1
*   **Core Logic:**
    *   **Data Loading & Caching:** Efficiently loads and caches policy data for the selected language and policy set.
    *   **Indexing & Search:** Policies and categories are indexed for fast searching.
    *   **Dynamic Rendering:** The UI is dynamically built and updated based on user interactions.

## üöÄ Getting Started / Usage

1.  **Access the Live Version:** [https://dooblpls.github.io/json-gpo/](https://dooblpls.github.io/json-gpo/)
    *   OR
2.  **Self-Hosting / Local Usage:**
    *   Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/dooblpls/json-gpo.git`
    *   Navigate to the project directory: `cd json-gpo`
    *   Open `index.html` in your web browser. (For local data loading to work correctly, you need to serve it via a simple local web server, e.g., using Python: `python -m http.server` or Node.js `npx serve`)

**Data Files:**

The application expects JSON data files (e.g., `24h2_en_US.json`, `edge_policies_en_US.json`) in the root directory (or a configured path). These files should contain the processed ADMX data. The structure includes:

*   `allCategories`: An array of category objects.
*   `allPolicies`: An array of policy objects.

Refer to the `POLICY_SETS` constant in `app.js` for how data files are named and associated with policy sets.

**Generate Data Files from ADMX/ADML:**
```
.\Generate-AdmxJson.ps1 -AdmxBasePath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Group Policy\Windows 11 Sep 2024 Update (24H2)\PolicyDefinitions\" -OutputPath ".\" -Languages "en-US", "de-DE" -SetName "24h2"
```

## üîß Configuration & Extension

### Adding New Policy Sets

1.  **Prepare your Data:** Parse your ADMX/ADML files into the required JSON format.
    *   *(Optional: Link to your parser tool/script or describe the expected JSON structure in more detail in a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` or wiki page.)*
2.  **Configure `app.js`:**
    *   Add a new entry to the `POLICY_SETS` array in `app.js`:
        ```javascript
        {
            id: 'your_set_id', // e.g., 'office_365'
            displayName: 'Your Policy Set Name', // e.g., 'Microsoft Office 365'
            isDefault: false,
            filePattern: (langCode) => `your_set_prefix_${langCode}.json` // e.g., office365_admx_en_US.json
        }
        ```
3.  **Add Data Files:** Place your generated JSON files (e.g., `your_set_prefix_en_US.json`, `your_set_prefix_de_DE.json`) in the application's root directory.

### Adding New Languages

1.  **Prepare Localized Data:** Generate JSON data files for the new language (e.g., `24h2_fr_FR.json`).
2.  **Update `index.html`:** Add an `<option>` to the `#language-select` dropdown:
    ```html
    <select id="language-select" ...>
        ...
        <option value="fr-FR">Fran√ßais (FR)</option>
    </select>
    ```
3.  **(Optional) Translate UI Strings:** If necessary, update any hardcoded UI strings in `getVirtualRootName` or other parts of `app.js` to support the new language if they are not already dynamic.
